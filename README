__Welcome to my Home Assistant configuration files.__

After many iterations of hardware, HAss now runs as a Docker container on an Inter NUC.

My hardware includes

* Tado Thermostat
* NetAtmo Weather including Wind and Rain modules
* NetAtmo Presence
* NetAtmo Welcome
* Ring doorbell
* Loads of Aeotec Z-Wave sensors
* Nest Protects (three)
* Hue Lights
* Arduino stuff
* TP-Link sockets


Other stuff to be added - this readme is about as organised as this configuration at the moment.
